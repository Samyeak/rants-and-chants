**I learn and I forget things.**

The above sentence summarizes my learning curve. In my daily activities, I encounter many problems. Problems I can fix in a blink. Problems I can't wrap my head around.

The problems that I tackle takes me one step ahead to my future. And the problems that I run away from takes me a hundred step backward. So, I try to not run away from problems and tackle them however I can. I may be familiar with some of these problems and some may be new to me.

So, I want to log these encounters in my daily life and I want to know how I handled them when I look back. I think if I can keep it up, it will create an impressive learning curve for me. From now on, I will be jotting down my experiences one by one as I encounter them. I consider myself a private person, so, I may not write everything in this platform. But I will make sure to jot it down nevertheless.
